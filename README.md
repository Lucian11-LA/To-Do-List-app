# To-Do-List-app
A simple, yet functional To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add and delete tasks with persistence using LocalStorage, meaning the tasks will remain even after a page reload or browser restart.
Features

    Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list.
    Delete Tasks: Users can remove completed or unwanted tasks.
    Persistence: All tasks are stored in the browser's LocalStorage, so they persist even after refreshing the page or restarting the browser.
    Simple UI: A clean and minimal user interface for easy task management.

Technologies Used

    HTML: For structuring the webpage.
    CSS: For styling the application.
    JavaScript: For dynamic behavior and functionality, such as adding/removing tasks and interacting with LocalStorage.

How It Works

    Adding Tasks: The user enters a task in the input field and clicks the "Add Task" button. The task is then added to the list and saved in LocalStorage.
    Removing Tasks: Each task has a "Delete" button next to it. When clicked, the task is removed both from the displayed list and from LocalStorage.
    Persistence: When the page reloads, the tasks are fetched from LocalStorage and displayed automatically, ensuring that tasks remain between sessions.
